# iLogic-External-Editor-Plugin
This is used to bridge your iLogic rules so that they can be accessed through external editors.

TODO: ADD INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP AND COMPILATION

Wishlist:
- Folder tree for sub assembly rules, so you can edit a whole project without reloading the app every time you change documents
- Snippets! (Vim plugin for snippets, maybe? Add to already existing coc-snippets plugin?)
